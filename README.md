<h1>Project Title: Next-Gen Text Generation using OpenAI API</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to build a text generation model using OpenAI API. Our model will be trained on a large corpus of text data and will be able to generate coherent and meaningful sentences in various languages. </p>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>OpenAI API</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-language text generation: The model can generate text in multiple languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, and more.</li>
  <li>Context-aware generation: The model takes into account the context of the input text and generates coherent and meaningful sentences.</li>
  <li>Customizable generation: The model can be fine-tuned to generate text in specific styles, tones, or genres.</li>
  <li>Real-time generation: The model can generate text on-the-fly, making it suitable for use in real-time applications.</li>
  <li>High accuracy: Our model is trained on a large corpus of text data, which ensures high accuracy and consistency in the generated text.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this project, you need to have a valid OpenAI API key. Once you have the API key, you can use the following code to generate text:</p>
<pre>
<code>const OpenAI = require('openai');

OpenAI.promise = require('bluebird');

const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";

OpenAI.promise.promisifyAll(OpenAI);

async function generateText(...</code>
</pre>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
